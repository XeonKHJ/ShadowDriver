<h2>What is this?</h2>

ShadowDriver a network utitlity library that allowing user-mode application to filter link layer and network layer packet data. 

<h2>How</h2>

Filtering link layer and network layer requires a kernel-mode driver. ShadowDriver is a kernel mode driver that expose an interface that accept IOCTL calls from user-mode app to control filtering process.

<h2>Progress</h2>

You can see the detail in [the project page](https://github.com/XeonKHJ/ShadowDriver/projects/3).
